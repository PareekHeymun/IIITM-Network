# IIITM-Network

We will be working in a **website format**. This will require some of the popular **.js libraries** (1) as @Shashwat Gupta will update us later. 

The next task is **DBMS**, which involves utilizing **Google Firebase**. This means integrating the **API Key** into our web-based application.

Later, we can integrate the website into our **mobile app**.

Some of the team members need to ensure that our app is protected by **'validity checks'** to keep hackers at bay, but that comes later. Tasks such as **pentesting**, **reverse engineering**, and other security measures need to be handled eventually. We will do all this research later.

### Current Main Task:
1. Decide the **libraries/technologies** we will be working with.
